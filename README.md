📊 Sales & Delivery Performance Analysis

Business Intelligence Case Study | SQL • Excel • Tableau

📌 Business Problem

Many organizations collect large volumes of sales and delivery data, but decision-makers often struggle with:

Fragmented reporting across tools

Lack of real-time visibility into sales performance

Limited insight into delivery efficiency and operational risks

Inconsistent KPI definitions that slow down decision-making

As a result, leaders are unable to quickly identify performance trends, operational bottlenecks, or areas requiring improvement.

Sales performance

Product and category trends

Regional performance

Delivery efficiency and reliability

The dashboard is intended to support data-driven commercial and operational decisions.
