## Dataset Description

The dataset is a **synthetic dataset generated for practice purposes**, simulating an e-commerce company's sales and delivery records. It contains **order-level data** with fields including:

- **Order_ID:** Unique identifier for each order  
- **Order_Date:** Date the order was placed  
- **Delivery_Date:** Date the order was delivered  
- **Product:** Name of the product ordered  
- **Category:** Product category (e.g., Electronics, Furniture)  
- **Quantity:** Number of units ordered  
- **Sales:** Total sales value (USD)  
- **Shipping_Cost:** Shipping cost (USD)  
- **Region:** Geographic region (North, South, East, West)  
- **Delivery_Status:** On-time or late delivery  

> This dataset allows demonstration of aggregation, filtering, grouping, and KPI calculation using SQL, alongside interactive visualization in Tableau.

## Tools Used

- **SQL:** KPI calculations, aggregations, summary metrics  
- **Excel:** Original dataset source and validation  
- **Tableau:** Interactive dashboards and visualizations

## Key Metrics / Dashboard Features

- **Total Sales ($):** Sum of all sales  
- **Total Quantity (Items):** Total units sold  
- **Total Shipping Cost ($):** Sum of shipping expenses  
- **Average Delivery Time (Days):** Average days between order and delivery  
- **Sales by Category:** Bar chart breakdown by product category  
- **Delivery Performance:** Pie chart of on-time vs. late deliveries  
- **Sales Over Time:** Monthly sales trends (line chart)  
- **Top Products:** Table of highest sales and profit products  
- **Sales by Region:** Geographic sales trends  
- **Percentage of On-Time Deliveries:** Delivery efficiency metric

## How to Use

1. Run the SQL script `DashboardMetrics.sql` to generate aggregated metrics  
2. Connect the Tableau workbook to the dataset (`Sheet1$` in Excel)  
3. Explore KPIs and visualizations: bar charts, pie charts, line charts, tables  
4. Use the dashboard to identify trends, top products, and operational areas for improvement  

---

## Project Notes

- Dataset is **AI-generated** for practice; data and dates are illustrative  
- SQL queries include **comments** explaining each metric  
- Dashboard follows **best practices**: KPIs at top, clear and simple visualizations  
- Easily adaptable to real-world datasets for further portfolio growth  

---

## Optional Improvements

- Add dynamic Tableau filters (e.g., by Region or Category)  
- KPI color indicators (green for good, red for alerts)  
- Connect dashboard to live data sources for real-time reporting  

---

## Repository Structure

- `SQL/` → SQL queries used for analysis  
- `Data/` → Dataset files  
- `Tableau/` → Tableau dashboard file
